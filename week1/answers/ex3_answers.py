Exercise 3 — Answers
====================
Fill this in after completing the three Rasa conversations.

CALM vs Old Rasa — what changed
---------------------------------
The old open-source Rasa approach used:
  - nlu.yml: intent training examples
  - rules.yml: explicit dialogue rules
  - FormValidationAction: Python class to parse slot values

Rasa Pro CALM uses:
  - flows.yml: natural language descriptions of what each flow does
  - from_llm slots: the LLM extracts values from conversation
  - ONE custom action: ActionValidateBooking for the business rules

The conversation is the same from the manager's perspective.
The machinery underneath is completely different.

CONVERSATION SCRIPTS
---------------------
Conversation 1 (happy path):
  You:    calling to confirm a booking
  Agent:  [asks guest count]
  You:    160 guests
  Agent:  [asks vegan count]
  You:    about 50 need vegan
  Agent:  [asks deposit]
  You:    £200 deposit
  Agent:  [confirms or escalates?]

Conversation 2 (deposit too high):
  Same as above but use a deposit above £300 (e.g. "£500 deposit").

Conversation 3 (out of scope):
  Start normally, then when asked for vegan count say something like
  "can you arrange parking for the speakers?" and observe what happens.
  Does CALM handle this differently than the old rules approach?

# Describe what CALM did after the out-of-scope message. Min 20 words.
CONVERSATION_3_WHAT_HAPPENED = """
It recognised the parking is out-of-scope, triggered the handle_out_of_scope flow (saying it can only help with booking confirmation). Added a follow up question to return to the booking flow.

# Compare Rasa CALM's handling of the out-of-scope request to what

OUT_OF_SCOPE_COMPARISON = """
Both handled the out-of-scope request gracefully without hallucinating.
LangGraph did it through open-ended reasoning and not guaranteed to reproduce each time.
CALM: deflection is a guaranteed, auditable path defined in flows.yml. It also preserved the booking flow state and offered to resume, whereas LangGraph simply ended the interaction.

Uncommented the cutoff guard, temporarily changed the hour threshold from 16 to 9 to trigger it during morning testing. Ran a happy-path conversation (160 guests, 50 vegan, £200 deposit) via the REST API and confirmed the agent escalated with "it is past 16:45" instead of confirming the booking. Then (!) I added proper tests with time mocks. :)
"""

# ── CALM vs Old Rasa ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# In the old open-source Rasa (3.6.x), you needed:
#   ValidateBookingConfirmationForm with regex to parse "about 160" → 160.0
#   nlu.yml intent examples to classify "I'm calling to confirm"
#   rules.yml to define every dialogue path
#
# In Rasa Pro CALM, you need:
#   flow descriptions so the LLM knows when to trigger confirm_booking
#   from_llm slot mappings so the LLM extracts values from natural speech
#   ONE action class (ActionValidateBooking) for the business rules
#
# What does this simplification cost? What does it gain?
# Min 30 words.

CALM_VS_OLD_RASA = """
CALM gains simplicity: LLM handle data classification and extraction with no parsing code (previously required training examples and regex), but python handles business rules (deposit limits, capacity checks) - those are deterministic. The cost is a dependency on the LLM => latency and occasional failures (e.g., 'around 50 vegan' was misunderstood in one run).
"""

# ── The setup cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# CALM still required: config.yml, domain.yml, flows.yml, endpoints.yml,
# rasa train, two terminals, and a Rasa Pro licence.
# The old Rasa ALSO needed nlu.yml, rules.yml, and a FormValidationAction.
#
# CALM is simpler. But it's still significantly more setup than LangGraph.
# That setup bought you something specific.
# Min 40 words.

SETUP_COST_VALUE = """
The extra setup (config.yml, domain.yml, etc) gives you auditability and constraints enforcement. The agent cannot call a tool not listed in flows.yml or bypass the python business rules. LangGraph can do anything its tools allow, but flexibility might be a disadvantage for finance-related case.
